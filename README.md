## User Story 

* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
